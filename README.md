# PR Assist
- Our application, PR Assist, is like having a virtual assistant for managing code contributions on GitHub.
- It helps developers by suggesting who should review their code, as well as providing recommendations for the title and description of their pull requests.
- It streamlines the process of submitting and reviewing code changes, making collaboration easier and more efficient for development teams.
